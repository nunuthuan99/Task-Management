 [CE Web Project] Task Management

This is [Trello](https://trello.com/vi) but more bugs, risks and not friendly.<br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
